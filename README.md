# PiTypeWryter
distraction free writing tool - use raspberry pi &amp; a kindle (or anything that is able to display a browser)

Direct inspiration from the following:
PiWrite
TypeWryter

This project consists of less hands-on hardware work. You can use a Kindle (and possible any tablet that has a browser) and a keyboard to use a simple distraction free text editor.
